# Suicidal-Intent-Detection-in-Hindi-English-Code-Mixed-Text-
This project focuses on detecting suicidal intent in Hindi-English code-mixed social media text. Since code-mixed data is highly informal, noisy, and low-resource, this work applies preprocessing, synthetic data generation, and multiple machine learning & deep learning models to classify suicidal vs. non-suicidal posts.

Key Features

1.Preprocessing Pipeline: Normalization and transliteration handling for Hindi-English code-mixed text.
2.Data Augmentation: Synthetic dataset expansion using LLM-based data generation to overcome low-resource constraints.
3.Model Benchmarking: Evaluated classical ML and deep learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, BiLSTM, CNN, SVM, etc.).
4.Best Results: SVM achieved 90.3% accuracy (F1: 0.90), outperforming deep learning baselines.
